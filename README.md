# Tic Tac Toe
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/tic-tac-toe-js).

## Functionality
This is the [Tic Tac Toe - JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript) project, where I create a Tic Tac Toe game, playable in the browser.

## Thoughts
After spending so much time on Ruby, it was an adjustment to come back to JS and start thinking of familiar concepts in slightly different ways. Overall the project was not difficult, and I think I spent the most time on the HTML and styling (done via Tachyons).

Making the JS functional wasn't difficult, but my code definitely feels a lot less organized than the Ruby projects I'd been working on recently. That'll be something to work on in future projects, and possibly bring back to this one at some point.

## Next steps
I'm sure my code is messier than it could be, so as I develop, I could certainly come back and improve it in the future.

The project also has an extra credit component: to build an AI that'll play against a human player. I won't do this quite yet, because I'm eager to continue down the road of JS lessons and projects with The Odin Project, but it might be fun to eventually return to.

God bless.
